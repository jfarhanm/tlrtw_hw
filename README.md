Raspberry pico firmware for tlrtw 

# tlrtw
TLRTW is this small , kinda childish robot that I am building to teach myself hardware communication protocols and to explore all the 
avaliable functionality of the raspberry pico dev boards.

Its has a raspberry pi zero on board for a  brain and a raspberry pico for the brawn. Currently communcation is done via SPI among these boards.
The raspberry  pi zero has cameras attached to it which shall be used for computer vision algorithms.

In addition to this , tlrtw shall also be used as a testbench to test [bbb](https://github.com/jfarhanm/bbb)
